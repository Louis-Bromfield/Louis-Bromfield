- 👋 Hi, I’m Louis Bromfield
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development and Data Analysis.
- 🌱 I have experience working in Java, JavaFX, MySQL, MERN (self-taught) and R (currently learning). I have a Politics BA and a Computer Science (conversion) MSc, both from Swansea University. I'm currently studying my PhD in Politics at Swansea as well, researching the effects of gamified political forecasting on political engagement.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational social science projects. I have made and am maintaining a betting odds tracker for the Tory leadership race (available here: https://sunak-truss-poll-watcher.herokuapp.com), but anything in this space interests me!
- 📫 How to reach me: My email is 908747@swansea.ac.uk and my LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-bromfield-7098071a4/
